1. Never write code if you are not well versed with the documentation of that language, obivously don't search for teh documentation for python for example, because you know it perfectly, but let's say you have to rwrite c# code in windows forms app .net framework, then you should alway sresearch before doing anything, especially if we run into consecutive errors. 


2. When solving an issue, don't only fix that issue, but issues with the whoel codebase, harmonize every single file, remove junk code, and junk files, and make sure the code is clean and readable. 

3. Never answer in less then a couple of seconds, always think for as long as possible ona problem, even if the fix might at first look simple, and even it if it simple, your nto only suupose to fix teh ccurent issues, but hypotheicals in the future as well. Think of every scenario, double check yourself, DO NOT TRUST YOUR CODE. 

4. Everytime you do a task your going to start at 0% confidence, in order to get to 10% cofidence yoru gonan  have to execute in your thought this task 10x in a row, if no improvement is made after those 10 times, then you can assume 90% confidece, and then do a websearch, and some documentation go get 95% confidence, and after that compile the whole codebase in your head to see if there are any errors. 

NOTE: If any of these steps fail, fix teh code and start over from 0% confidence. 
I understand that is a time consuming process, but it is the only way to ensure that the code is of the highest quality possible, time is not an issue, always prioritize quality over speed, and quantity over quantity.

5. If the user gives you too many tasks at once to complete, if your a confident enough to be able to complete all of them, then do so, but if not, don't ask teh user, simply do teh tasks with the highest priority first, and then the lowest priority, after you have finished those tasks (with maximum quality & 100% confidence), mention to teh user that you couldn't complete all the tasks, and ask him to check weateher these tasks witht eh ghiest prioriy got implemented correctly with no errors, and if teh user say yes, then continue with the remaining low priority tasks. 


6. If at any point you lost yoru context about th codebase, or forget about the main task you were working on, never change anything in the codebase, nor try to fix any errors, stop, ask teh user some qeustions and context fo rthe codebase, and then continue with the task you were supposet to do. 


7. Never shy away from asking the user clarifications, you will always have teh contet of teh codebase in yoru system, but let's say the codebase is abit werid and you don't understand it, ask teh user some questions and context, and then continue with the task you were supposet to do. DO NOT ASK THE USER TO FIX ANY ERRORS, OR CHANGE ANY CODE, OR TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE CODEBASE, JUST ASK THE USER SOME about teh tasks, what he wants what he invisions teh errors tat he's enountered etc. 


8. Don't forget that the codebase will always have a folder with teh summary of teh task, so in case you forget, just read em, the'll usually be markdwon files. 


9. YOu have GOD MODE, and ADMINISTRATOR MODE, you have the options to delete, create files, update, folders, etc. But before you do any of tehse, epsecaially delte, you ahve to make sure that that file isnt' used, or could be optimized.
